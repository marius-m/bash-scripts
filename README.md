As using CLI is quite common thing for me, I have a set of scripts that I use to automate some steps. So this is a wild west of the scripts that I use ü§†Ô∏è.

My daily driver os macOS + [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). More common than none, you&rsquo;ll need homebrew to install some of the utils.

Sorry, no documentation in most of them ü§∑Ô∏è
